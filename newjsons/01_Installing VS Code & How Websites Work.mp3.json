According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. Intro Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come along, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly here. This license applies to... Damages And after this I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next we will do. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. Check it. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop here. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this we will do next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow. Then there is no problem. It will be a little slow install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please. You guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also happen. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will happen in that too. Here we set it up. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here. We set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I did all this. Next section. After this next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again here are some tips. Telling you. That's it. This is your VS Code here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you. That you close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in windows. So you can see here. That an option called open with code is coming. This option called open with code. Helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say yes I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey I am your first html file. Suppose I have written this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you. That you go to the file. And enable the auto save option here. So as you type. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want to save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you. You click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check this and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is it? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this. Now you will simply press ctrl. And scroll like this. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. In the folder named sigma web development course. What happened? That this file was made. Index dot html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this dot txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. So this folder and this VS code. Both are running in sync. Now if I open this file from here. From the notepad. And I will show you. My file is opened in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because there are some things in VS code. Which notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I do not want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code? Which you do not get in the notepad. If I write here. Suppose html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. Now you do not get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use notepad. Why we used VS code. And this feel comes. We are getting such a good feel. The developer's feel is coming. The hacker's feel is coming. That feel is also important. That is why the confidence will come. To do coding. Now for mac and linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen. For you too. I am using windows. Because I have a windows laptop. I can not use three laptops. I can not use linux, mac and windows. I can not use all three at once. So for you. Exactly the same things will be there. In fact I should say. Similar things will be there. Not exactly the same. Very similar things will be there. So you can follow along. Very easily. So do not take tension. I will tell you about some extensions. And you will enjoy. By using those extensions. And you will also say. It is fun. What did you recommend. But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. I would like to tell you before that. You will click on the right. Click on the command palette. So here are a lot of options for VS code. You do not need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You do not have to do this. But I will do. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So you see I will type anything. If I press caps lock. So here caps lock will come. So you will know. Which button I pressed when. Now this thing is for you. Not at all relevant. But I just want to tell you. What is the screencast mode. What is the screencast mode. We can change its settings from here. Now here you see. Screencast mode's vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset zero. So it came up. If I make vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That is. From bottom how much will it look up. So I made it zero. In fact I made it one. Now I will type anything here. Suppose I did this. It will show you at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is. I will close this file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know. What is it? What we have written about it. You will forget. I will tell you step by step. What is exactly what is it? You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because. I am recording videos. So ideally I would like. That you can see the screen from close. But when I am doing my coding. Then I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work? A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is the other? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser. So browser, client, server. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will tell the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what I basically say? I say. From this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. Youtube.com I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see youtube. What does the browser say? You want youtube? Take this. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. Youtube.com. He brought it. Are you understanding? From the server. Youtube.com. He brought it. He showed me this screen by parsing. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. Nowadays people are even faster. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So with this fast internet speed. All these things are very fast. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser is the client. That is my assistant. Whatever I say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. Youtube. Youtube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me. This kind of code. That is when I write. Youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is of the browser. That is how to show me. This work is of the browser. So the client says to the browser. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid you want youtube.com. Wait I will ask for youtube.com. Youtube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. Means a request is sent to the server. Server says. Give me youtube.com. Server will either give it. Or will say no. Or will say error. Or will say that the server has been errored. Whatever response will be. Ideally it should be 200. Response code is 200. With that response. Our browser. Comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. So client to the browser. Browser to the server. Back to the browser. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I will tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website google.com. So client. Says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait I will also bring it from the server. So goes to the server. Browser. And brings google.com. And gives you. You get google.com. Now with google.com. The server. All images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends all. Like these icons. These icons. The URL is also written in this code. And that too. The job of the browser. To display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The job of the browser. Now whatever further interaction. User with this page. Browser will give additional request. If I do right click. And inspect. And then I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Assume I wrote Harry bhai. So see so many requests. He sent for images. And many more requests. He sent. So as you interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it like a restaurant. You gave the order. Means sent the request. As soon as you gave the order. Your order. A waiter took it. That waiter. Then went inside the kitchen. He sent your order. Kitchen you consider the server. And after this. Finally when the kitchen. Gave the order back. So what did this waiter do. Which is the work of the browser. That waiter. He gave you back the order. It is possible that the order. Is not made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you order something. And you did not get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly here. Sometimes it happens. That error is seen. 404 error. Or 500 error. Server is not working. Such errors. So whenever such errors. Are seen. Then also you are told. That the server is not working. So that's why. You are told. That the server is not working. But ideally. 200. Means. Ok response. And you get. Such a webpage. So you can. Consider it. Like a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com. Slash mail. So if google.com. Slash mail is available. Then it will show you. And if you write. Codewithari.com. Slash contact. So codewithari.com. Slash contact. If it is available. Then it will show you. If it is not available. Then it will show 404. Or if there is 500 error. Then it will show you. A page with 500. Whatever server. Will send. Then the server. The server then processed the request. After this. The server has. Send the data back to the browser. And whatever the data is sent. Browser showed it to the client. Then the client did something. Then the browser sent. The same request to the server. Then the server sent something. Whatever data the server sent. It came back to the client. To the browser. And so on. So now you say. All this is okay. But what is this backend. What does the back end mean? Back end is. How the server is processing. The request. Now if you consider. They have a blog. There is a lot of. Data on the blog. So you can. See the data. There's a lot of data in it. So what you'll do is, you'll store every webpage separately. Or you'll generate the content dynamically. I'll take google's example. If i search harry bhai, you can see Google's header, links, This format doesn't change. If i write here, So as soon as i write here, When i wrote harry bhai, Google is showing me similar content. Google's server's backend Processes the data in such a way That it can send this kind of HTML for the query. When i write Shubham, it sends this. When i write harry bhai, it sends this. The process of generating this Is happening through the same backend. This backend can be nodejs, PHP, ruby on rails. The database inside the backend is used. The backend code is not visible to the client. This is the frontend code that the server sends. We don't know how the server made this code. If you're confused, don't be. We'll see the backend later. Now we'll understand how the frontend works. The frontend is made of 3 languages. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the 3 languages that are needed If you're making a website. HTML, CSS, JavaScript are needed. If you use HTML, It becomes a basic skeleton of the website. When you use CSS, you can style it. Like this button is visible because of CSS. This button is visible because of CSS. This button is visible because of CSS. These edges are visible because of CSS. CSS is used to style the page. What color will be the button? All these things are done through CSS. CSS is the beauty of HTML. HTML is the existence of any page. It is a standard that has been agreed. Any website will be made in HTML. So that the browser can understand how to parse. The browser's job is to parse the HTML. HTML is a skeleton. Any website will be made in HTML. It is a standard. This standard is made so that everyone Make the same type of pages. If anyone is making a browser, then the same language has to be parsed. If you have learned 80% HTML, then you are good to go for web development. Now some things happen directly from HTML. If I write a very quick HTML code, I am writing HTML code like this. I have used the emmet abbreviation. You don't have to worry about how I wrote this code. I will write this is HTML. I can open this HTML file directly. As soon as I open this HTML file, You can see that it will open like this. I can open it directly by double clicking. It is open. But it is not styled at all. This HTML file is very basic. You can run videos directly from HTML. I have an HTML file that I show you. I will show you this HTML file. So that we can show videos in it. If you enter the video, then whatever video you put in the SRC will be played. If I put video 1.mp4 here, You see, VS Code automatically showed me video 1.mp4. This is the benefit of using VS Code. I will reload it. I can play this video. I have to write controls to play. I will refresh it now. This is a very expensive plane. This guy needs a lot of money. He wants 130 crores. He is asking for 130 crores. If I put video 2.mp4 here, I have two more videos. I have some more videos here. If I put video 2.mp4 here, You will see video 2.mp4. I will reload it. This was Ben Stokes's lookalike. If I put video 3.mp4 here, My third video will play. I will reload it. You can see, I can play it. This is our third video. I put video 3.mp4 here. I will close it. I have a DJ video. You can see. You can make such things using only HTML. You don't have to do anything else. You can play videos and images with HTML. You can do all this with HTML. If you want to style it. If you want to style it. You have to use CSS. CSS adds beauty to any website. Then comes JavaScript. It adds interaction to a website. For example, when I click on search. When I type code with Harry. Why did it come? Because a request came. For this query, Autocomplete results came. These things are done with JavaScript. This is called client-side scripting. If you want to do coding in the client. You can do it with JavaScript. This is also called Brain. Beauty with Brain. Beauty with Brain. JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic. If you want to change the content. This is done with JavaScript. There are many mosquitoes here. They are not getting anything. My racket is working. Like the video. When I was in college. I was told to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. But this is wrong. Because HTML is only 80%. CSS is only 40-60%. JavaScript is only 50-70%. You can start web development. You can make projects. I will tell you about chat gpt. And its impact on web development. We will talk about this. So don't run after perfection. Don't think that you will do HTML. And then CSS. And then JavaScript. HTML 80%. CSS 40-60%. And JavaScript 50-70%. And you can make a website. And you will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. And you will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. While you are making money. And working as a professional web developer. You are earning along with learning. And you are improving your skills. Don't think that you will learn HTML. And then make a website. I will teach you only that much. And you will learn what matters. I don't want you to learn only. So I have designed this course. And you will learn other things from practice. And I will teach you many things from this course. And we have a lot of people here. We will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. And I will teach you tricks. And I have taught you tricks. I have taught you many tricks. I have taught you many tricks. I have taught you many tricks. And I want you to learn these tricks. If you have any doubt. You can use this hashtag. I will try to answer all the doubts. I will try to answer all the doubts. If you have any question. You can use this hashtag. And you can use this hashtag. And you can use this hashtag. So that I can answer your questions. I will try to answer all the doubts. And you will learn everything from this course. So like this course. That will bring a smile on my face. So what is React, Next.js, Angular. These are the front end frameworks. These help you to use JavaScript. HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the basis of a website. These help you to make the process fast. We will learn this in this course. I will make this course for you. I will make you a hero in web development. You can buy a seat. Because you have bought a ticket for Sigma web development express. I will give you the terminology. HTML is just like car skeleton. CSS is internal engine car. That is JavaScript. For example, a human. Skeleton is HTML. CSS is skin. And brain is JavaScript. I will take you to Forbes.com Here is a website. Forbes.com is a website. Which uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript. If I click on inspect. Here is the inspect element. Here they have used script in head. And to add CSS. They have used link. I will remove their CSS. I will remove their style tags. I will delete them. As soon as I remove all the style tags. And all the link tags. As soon as I delete all the style sheets. This page is like this. It has raw HTML. It has no size. It has raw HTML. Without CSS. It has raw buttons. Raw links. And similarly, I can remove the script tags. Without JavaScript. If I delete the HTML tag. I have deleted the head. It is a blank page. This is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This course was made to be paid. But I changed my mood. And I thought of making it free. I want you to be serious. I have been reached out to launch a paid course. But I wanted to keep it free. Because when I was learning web development. I understood that you don't have a course. And you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course. So I decided to launch this course. This course is free. But as you earn crores. You will give me tea, coffee, parties. This is our agreement. So when you earn crores. Send me a green card. But you have to do this only when you earn well. So in the next video. I will tell you how you can earn money. I will tell you how to earn money. How to earn money. How I do freelancing. How do clients come. I will tell you everything. I will tell you some action items. I will give you the playlist in the description. Everyone bookmark the playlist. Click on the bookmark button. And click on the save button. Many people said that the course is paid. Thank you so much for all the support. This course is going to be free. Technical issues should not come. I am putting these videos in 1080p. So you should see it clearly. But many people say that the video is in SD. You watch Bali ka Vadhu. And you watch Bali ka Vadhu. And you say that your videos are not HD. Call the municipality. So I hope you understood the request. How these websites work. How client-server interaction works. In the coming videos we will see. How the website is made. So you should be very excited. Because in the next video our first website is going to be made. And it may be the first website of many of you. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Music."
