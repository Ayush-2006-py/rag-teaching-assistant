    "text": " In today's video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML. We saw in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10 and I will not waste your time by opening open with code by right-clicking and shifting. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some other attributes which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to you will write here like this. So if you have video.mp4, it will play. I have video.mp4. So let's see here. I have put it here with control and I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Okay, now it's a very big video. So what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I don't need to write px. I will only do 555. Like we don't need to write px in the image. Here too we will not need to write px. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing. I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller. I make it 255. And you see it came here. Okay, now I play it because I have put control. I can play it. What did you say? What name did you say? Where did you go in the US? I have gone to many places in the US. Tell me the name. So what is it that you can play the video like this. Now here are some attributes of the video tag. See, it is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that you have given the controls. So these controls will come to you. You can download it. You can do full screen. You can do mute. You can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is src. So you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is src. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand that if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else. So I can also put the URL there. It is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can be on your server. It can also come from the third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the video of Bhupendra Jogi. That you are getting to see the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically sees what the control ads will be in your video. What will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page is loaded. So if I put autoplay here. Suppose I put autoplay here. Okay. See what is happening here. So you can see that it is autoplay here. So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will loop. Like I show you. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here on codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something like downloading VS Code or something. So I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want when I record a video. If there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will make a video by scrolling like this. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute in your website. Then the poster. The poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. If I write here, poster is equal to. And I write download.jpg. So you see, it will look something like this. This is how the poster looks. Then I will play. So the video will play. So in a way, the thumbnail. You saw the thumbnail of the YouTube video. This is exactly the same. This is the poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. You know that the width and height specify the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz. Okay. So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very fun quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio, src comes here. And I have to put src in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put src is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls, I won't see the audio. See now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set its volume. I play this audio. Sachin, what is in sachin? It's a bad sachin. Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it, it won't work. And I can also increase it further. It's a bad sachin. Okay. You people have seen. So this is audio named sachin.mp3. Now what we will do. That we will see some attributes of this audio. You know src. Source of the video file. Okay. Then after this, you know the controls. Play, pause and volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will automatically play it. If I have here. Autoplay. Sachin, what is in sachin? It will automatically play it. It's a bad sachin. Okay. So what does autoplay do? It automatically plays our audio. After this. The next attribute is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat it. If I want to loop it. So I have autoplayed it. Now I will loop it. Sachin, what is in sachin? It's a bad sachin. Once. Sachin, what is in sachin? Second time. It's a bad sachin. So you saw it was repeated. Means it was played once. Then it was played again. Because it is looped. So you saw this thing. Sachin.mp3 looped. Means it was played once. Then it was played. Then it was played. Sachin, what is in sachin? It was repeated. Because this mp3. Will be played again and again. So there are many cases. When you want. This mp3 to be repeated. Okay. So if you want. Your mp3 to be repeated. Then you can use it. Now after this. Muted. What will it do? It will mute the audio. And definitely. You will hear. The sound. It will be muted. So you can hear. The sound. So you can hear. So you can hear. So you can hear. And definitely. You don't want. By default. Your audio to be muted. In most of the cases. But. Sometimes we want. That. The audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. Brother, whoever wants to hear. Unmute. Sachin, what is it? When do we do this? Which are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios at once. You can mute them. Your user can play. Unmute. And see. Okay. So. You have control in your hand. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. All in all. This is the thing. I hope you enjoyed it. Now preload. The most confusing. Attribute. And that's why I have. Explained it on codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates. That the browser should not. Preload the audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. That the browser fetches the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise. You will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. Default value. Preload is equal to metadata. Means. That the browser. Will not fetch the data. Okay. Preload is equal to metadata. Means. That the browser. Only the metadata. That is. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. It will load it from the beginning. And what will happen by doing auto. That the browser. Will preload the entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do. Then it will download. And automatically. Will be loaded. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio is saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. This preload attribute is asked a lot. So you should know. That what is the preload attribute. Before moving forward. I want you to. Share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. As we are moving forward in the videos. My request to you is. That you like this video. And along with that. As you are forking this repository. You should also star it. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was. About audio and video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. And you should definitely use it. I will give you all the images. So that you can. Understand it. Okay. So. I am signing off. I am signing off. I am signing off. I will give you all the links. So that you can try it out. Now a lot of people were asking. Can we use replit? See, I have not used. Replit in this course. But replit. Is an amazing website if you all want. Use it on the phone. If you want to run. HTML, etc. There is a replic app for iOS. There is also an android. So you can try it out. A lot of people are asking. How to do coding on the phone. Replit But what am I also wanting. VS Code. Which is wanted. Most of the people. People prefer. I thought why not make videos in VS code But I personally use replit a lot Infact videos also comes in replit Next topic is SVG SVG is a format With which you can create image With high graphics So if you copy You can make circle in it So SVG is used exactly like How our IMG tag is used If I put SVG here So this SVG will come here Video, Audio, SVG These are inline elements That's why we are seeing them in one line You have seen it Now here you can Save SVG file separately You can save it separately If I write here IMG.SVG And save the content of SVG If I write here IMG And write here IMG.SVG So you can see here That I didn't get this image If I write here alt And write my svg image So you can see here My svg image came like this But I didn't get to see svg Why this happened? Because svg is I write svg file in browser And when you want to see svg file in browser You will put a declaration I will show you So I wrote svg file not showing So here There is an answer of stack overflow So you have to write this XML Something like this You have to add this This is called namespace declaration So you have to add this svg And now you can see svg here This is very important And many people in future When you will make websites You will get stuck in this problem So I am telling you I have already told you You didn't get the problem I have told you the problem and solution Next topic is iframes Iframes is a very simple thing You can embed another website In your website If I want to embed this webpage I can use iframes like this So I wrote iframes And I will copy this url And I will paste here And you can see here This website is fully embedded In this iframe You definitely want to embed in a big iframe But if you want to embed You can embed like this I will increase the height So width is equal to Let's say 122 Height is equal to 444 Ok So it came like this Now definitely it was coming in this width So it came in this line But let's increase the width 322 So see here It is fully embedded So you can embed a website Another use case of iframes is Youtube video If you want to share youtube video And click on embed It will give you iframe code And you can start it from here If you want to start at a particular time You can do that here The point at which you will start And share it Let's say i want to start from here Let's say video starts from here So what i will do is click on share After clicking on share i will click on embed I will start at 1219 And i will copy it And i will put it in my code So i will comment this iframe And i will put it in the iframe below I will do word wrap So that you can see the code properly So now what i will do is After pasting this I will show you the document So now it is fully embedded I hope you understood this And Media is only this in html Miscellaneous in every topic You will see many things But pretty much that's all about media In html audio, video, media This is what you will use 95% of the times Now i will give you a quick quiz And your quick quiz is Create a website Which shows videos of different category And audios of different category You can use YouTube videos In an iframe using youtube's Embedding feature So what you have to do is You have to make a website In which you will get a lot of content Now you can use video audio tags And youtube's share feature The way i have embedded youtube video You can also embed it in the same way And make a very good website And show me You can also give me your comment And if you want You can also tell me the code But do attempt this quiz And do write sigma batch op in the comment section Access this playlist Like the video And do write sigma batch op Thank you so much for watching this video And i will see you next time Outro Music"
